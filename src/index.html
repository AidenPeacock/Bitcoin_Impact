      <h2><center>How is Bitcoin using this much energy?</center></h2>
      <p>
        Bitcoin's philosophy is based on a financial 
        system without trust, and a key aspect of the online currency is in using the computational power of many computers to 
        guarentee safety from a malicious actor attempting to insert false transactions into
        the digital leger which keeps track of all transactions, (the blockchain). To work around the problem Bitcoin attaches a 
        very long number to each section of memory, and computers use this number to solve a mathematical problem, whos solution scales with
        the individual computing power spent on the problem, such that every 10 minutes it is able to be solved.
        To prevent someone with a sufficiently large computer taking over the whole
        system. This is where most of bitcoins' energy use comes from, as with millions of computers working on the same mathematical problem,
        the problem scales to require those millions of computers to run at full capacity to solve it in 10 minutes. Once a single computer finds the hash,
        the millions of other computers that did not throw away the work they had just done, essentially wasting that power.

      <h2><center>What is the math problem miners are trying to solve?</center></h2>
      <p>
      Miners have access to the data that makes up the newest block of memory, and this combined with 
      a random number is put through an encryption algorithm SHA-256, that can turn any data into a 256 bit number.
      The miners are looking for the number that when run through the algorithm with the block data, produces a value with
      an amount of zeros at the end, with this number of zeros being determined by how much computing power is currently being
      used to solve the problem. SHA-256 is designed to be unreversable and so the best method miners have is guessing numbers
      until someone finds a solution. Keep trying numbers until your hash ends in a zero, (each number has a different hash). This is the computation 
      bitcoin miners are doing and spending the energy on. Looking for hashes with some amount of zeros at the end based on total
      computing power being spent on the problem.

        <h2><center>Mining Bitcoin has costed our future selves <span id="deficit"></span>$</center></h2>
      <p>Using conservative estimates on the cost to humans and the climate on burning one tonne of coal, and 
        taking into account around 25% of bitcoin mining is done with renewable energy, and subtracting the value of the bitcoin created from the cost,
        we can see that it generates a large net deficit to our society. While bitcoin is accepted as currency at some major companies, is the good it
        provides as a currency outweight the massive externalities it creates? This cost will only increase as every 4 years, the bitcoin reward for solving
        the mathematical problem (currently at 6.25 bitcoin), halves.

      </div>
      <div id="energy_box">
      <h2><center>Can Bitcoin replace physical currency?</center></h2>
      <p>Since the Bitcoin system creates new memory for transactions every 10 minutes, this provides a hard 
        limit for how many transactions can possibly occur and be stored. Bitcoin can handle 7 transactions per second in a best case scenario, this works 
        out as 220 million transactions every year at an absolute maximum. We would have to rethink how we transacted online currency as Visa, one of
        the major handlers of online tranactions, processed over "200 Billion" transactions in 2022. The system put in place to guarentee complete trust
        has bottlenecked Bitcoins viability as anything more than a system for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

      <h2><center>Bitcoin has consumed the equivalent of <span id="oilbarr"></span> barrels of oil</center></h2>
      <p>Bitcoin's imact on our environment cannot be understated, as it currently uses 0.55% of the worlds total energy production. 
        But even if Bitcoin was created using 100% renewable energy, the technology that dedicated bitcoin miners use is tailor made to 
        solve the kind of problem posed by the Bitcoin network. Once newer and better hardware is created, this technology cannot be recycled
        and ends up being thrown out, creating an e-waste footprint larger than Switzerland's.
